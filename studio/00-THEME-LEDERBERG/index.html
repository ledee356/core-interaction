    <h1>Theme: Cinema's Representation of Diversity</h1>

    My theme is on contemporary cinema,
    specifically on the representation of <br>
    diversity in film. I will be examining
    whether there has a been a change and <br>
    whether or not more work needs to be done
    on telling different types of stories in film. <br>
