    <h1>Theme: Cinema's Representation of Diversity</h1>

    My theme is on contemporary cinema,
    specifically on the representation of
    diversity in film. I will be examining
    whether there has a been a change and whether
    or not more work needs to be done on telling
    more types of stories in film.
