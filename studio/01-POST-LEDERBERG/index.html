  Moonlight was a coming of age drama released on October 21, 2016.<br>
  Centered around a young black man growing up in Miami as he tries<br>
  to figure out his sexuality, it was lauded for it’s honest portrayal<br>
  of Miami and it's moving story.

  The film was incredibly successful and even went on to win Best Picture at<br>
  the Academy Awards the following year. It became not only the first LGBT<br>
  film win best picture, but the first film with an all black cast, making<br>
  it a revolutionary win for the filmmaking industry and large step in the right<br>
  direction for proper representation throughout all of cinema.

  But not only wasthere representation in front of the camera, there was also<br>
  representation behind it as well,leading to one of the film’s editors to be the <br>
  first black woman to be nominated for an editing Oscar.

  Now if we take a look back about 40 years earlier to 1980, the Best Picture winner<br>
  was a film called Ordinary People. Featuring an all white cast, the movie focused on a how a<br>
  father, mother, and son cope with the loss of their son/brother. While the son tries to deal with<br>
  his feelings about the situation, his mother just tries to bury it all deep within herself.<br>

  While it is considered a good film, it is telling another white story,<br>
  the type of story that has been told before and thus isn’t pushing the boundaries<br>
  or doing anything “new.” Taking a look at the nominations of that year, the big four<br>
  acting awards nominees are all white, showing what an issue this was back in the day.<br>
  While it may be apparent now, it took quite a long time to get to where we are<br>
  now, where a movie like Moonlight could even be considered to win the Best Picture award.<br>
