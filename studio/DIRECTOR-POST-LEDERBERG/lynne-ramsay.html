          <p>Born in Glasgow on 5 December 1969, Ramsay studied photography at Napier College, Edinburgh. In 1995, she graduated from the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield, England, where she specialised in cinematography and direction. Ramsay won the 1996 Cannes Prix de Jury for her graduation film, the short "Small Deaths". Her second short film, "Kill the Day", won the Clermont Ferrand Prix du Jury; her third, "Gasman", won her another Cannes Prix du Jury in addition to a Scottish BAFTA for Best Short Film.

          Ratcatcher (1999), Ramsay's debut feature, won critical acclaim and numerous awards. It was screened at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival[5] and opened the Edinburgh International Film Festival, winning her the Guardian New Directors prize. We Need to Talk about Kevin (2011) was Ramsay's next feature-length film in which she was the writer, producer and director. The film, based on Lionel Shriver's novel, is about a mother dealing with the aftermath of a school massacre committed by her son. Ramsey directed an adaptation of Jonathan Ames' novella You Were Never Really Here. The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix, was released in 2017 with distribution from Amazon Studios.[13] You Were Never Really Here (2017) premiered to wide critical acclaim in competition at the 70th Cannes Film Festival. It received a seven-minute standing ovation, and Ramsay won the Best Screenplay award.
