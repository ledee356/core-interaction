    <p>
      Based on the 2007 novel, Call Me By Your Name written by André Aciman,
      the film is centered around a young 17 year old named Elio growing up in Northern Italy
      in 1983 and is a masterful love story. Elio’s world is upended when he falls
      in love with his father’s 24 graduate student Oliver who happens to be staying with
      them for the entire summer. The film follows the two of them as they fall in love and
      captures their shared experience that is equally filled with passion and torment.
      The film is directed by Luca Guadagnino and is also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay,
      Best Actor, and Best Original Song.
