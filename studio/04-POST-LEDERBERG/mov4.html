  A film that is unlike any other nominated this year, Get Out is a horror film with a lot on its mind. Main character Chris is invited to spend a weekend at his girlfriend’s parent’s estate. However, things quickly go from bad to worse when he is hypnotized and kidnapped, with his “girlfriend’s” family trying to take his body and replace his brain with that of a white man. The film is a social thriller at the top of its game, providing commentary on the current racial situation today in America. The film was also nominated for Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay.
