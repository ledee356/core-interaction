    <h1>Representation in the 90's</h1>

  <div class="text">

    A decade known for MTV music videos and nickelodeon slime, the 1990’s was home <br>
    to many future contemporary cinematic classics. One of the best known films from the decade,<br>
    Pulp Fiction, was written and directed by future legendary film director Quentin Tarantino.<br>
    The film was known for its multiple intertwined story lines and non-linear storytelling. <br>
    The film ended up winning the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. However, that wasn’t the <br>
    only film Tarantino released in the decade, he also dropped his first feature in 1992, <br>
    Reservoir Dogs. While it shared similar violence and views as Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs <br>
    was a much more traditional heist film.
